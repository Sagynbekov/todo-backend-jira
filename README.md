# Todo Backend Jira (Educational Pet Project)

A backend REST API for a Jira-like task and project management application, created for learning and demonstration purposes.  
This project is part of a full-stack example (see [todo-frontend-jira](https://github.com/Sagynbekov/todo-frontend-jira)) and is inspired by Atlassian Jira.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> **This is an educational pet project (Jira analog).**
> - The code and architecture are for learning and demo purposes only.
> - If you want to use this system in production, you must refactor and significantly improve it, especially regarding security, error handling, and database design.
> - The code may use simplified authentication, validation, and storage mechanisms.

## Features

- **User Authentication** (supports Firebase JWT or simple local user model)
- **Project Management**
  - Create, edit, delete projects
  - Assign project owners and members
- **Kanban-style Board Support**
  - Projects have columns (statuses) and tasks (cards)
  - Add, update, move, and delete columns and tasks
- **Task Assignment**
  - Assign tasks to users, mark as complete, overdue, etc.
- **User and Team Management**
  - Project member management, invitations
- **Analytics Endpoints**
  - Member activity, overdue tasks, completion stats
- **RESTful API Design**
  - Follows REST conventions for endpoints and responses
- **CORS Support**
  - Designed for use with the [todo-frontend-jira](https://github.com/Sagynbekov/todo-frontend-jira) frontend

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI (or Django REST Framework, check codebase)
- **Database:** SQLite (default, for demo); easily replaceable with PostgreSQL/MySQL for real use
- **Authentication:** Firebase JWT, or custom model (for learning)
- **Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI auto-generated by FastAPI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Sagynbekov/todo-backend-jira.git
   cd todo-backend-jira
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables if needed (for Firebase or database config).

4. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

5. The API will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

   - Swagger docs: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## API Overview

- `/api/projects/` — CRUD for projects
- `/api/columns/` — CRUD for columns in a project
- `/api/tasks/` — CRUD for tasks in columns
- `/api/firebase-users/` — User endpoints (list, create, find by email)
- `/api/auth/` — Auth endpoints (login, register, etc.)
- `/api/analytics/` — Project/user analytics (overdue tasks, member activity, etc.)

_Note: See Swagger docs for all endpoints and exact parameters._

---

## Example Usage

- **Create a project** with owner and members
- **Add columns** (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done")
- **Assign tasks** to users
- **Track overdue and completed tasks**
- **Integrate** with the [frontend](https://github.com/Sagynbekov/todo-frontend-jira)

---

## Future Improvements

- Switch to a production-grade database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Implement robust authentication and permissions (OAuth2, role-based access)
- Improve error handling and validation
- Add real-time notifications (WebSocket support)
- Add unit and integration tests
